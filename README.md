Execute a repeated task by typing `Ctrl-T`.

* After typing `abcabc`, you can get another `abc` by typing `Ctrl-T`.
* You can get more `abc`'s by typing more `Ctrl-T`'s.

### Limitations

* Applicable only to simple editing tasks.
* Key binding to `Ctrl-T` is hard-coded and unchangeable.
(hopefully fixed later)
